This application is a work in progress GUI Magic the Gathering Commander deck builder.
The requirements doc for this project implements the deck building restrictions for the Commander format.
Some of these restrictions/logic have already been implemented.
The main items that need to be finished are some statistical analysis and GUI clean up.

This application was created using the Scryfall API and was created to further my skills 
in working with mainly JSON but also APIs in general and the tkinter toolkit.
